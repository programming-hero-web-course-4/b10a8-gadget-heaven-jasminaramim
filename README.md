## React Fundamental Concepts Used

This project incorporates several fundamental concepts of React, including:

- **Components**: Reusable UI elements (functional components).
- **Props**: Passing data between components.
- **State Management**: Managing component state using `useState`.
- **Effect Hook**: Side effects management using `useEffect`.
- **React Router**: Implementing routing for navigation between different pages.
- **Context API**: Managing global state (cart and wishlist) across the application.
- **Custom Hooks**: Creating hooks for cart and wishlist functionality.
- **Controlled Components**: Managing form inputs and UI elements.
  
## Data Handling and Management

Data handling in the project is managed using:

- **Context API**: Used for managing global state for the shopping cart and wishlist, allowing components to access and modify the cart items and wishlist items without prop drilling.
- **Local Storage**: (Optional) Implemented to persist user preferences or cart data across sessions (if applicable).

## Features of the Website/Project

Here are five key features of the Gadget Heaven application:

1. **Responsive Design**: The application is fully responsive and works well on various devices and screen sizes, providing a great user experience.

2. **Shopping Cart Functionality**: Users can add gadgets to their cart, view the cart contents, and remove items as needed. The total item count is displayed in the navbar.

3. **Wishlist Feature**: Users can save their favorite gadgets in a wishlist, preventing the need to search for items repeatedly. The wishlist also displays the total count in the navbar.

4. **Product Details Page**: Each product has a dedicated details page that showcases more information, including images, descriptions, and pricing, with options to add to cart or wishlist.

5. **Category Navigation**: Users can filter gadgets by categories, allowing them to find specific items quickly without navigating through unrelated products.
